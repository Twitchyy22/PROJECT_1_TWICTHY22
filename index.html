<h1>"I love you"</h1>
<h2>Poem by Kayla Jenkins</h2>
  
  <p>"I Love You!"
    <br>I love you too! It's a beautiful day, I hope you don't miss out on whats to come.
    <br>I hope you don't miss out on whats to come.
    <br>I miss you!
  </p>

  <p>"I Love you"
    <br>Hey, I haven't heard from you in awhile,
    <br>I hope you are doing well.
  </p>
  
  <p> "Love you"
    <br> Crazy. The slightest change was neccesary.
    <br> I got the message.
  </p>

   <p> "Ily"
    <br> These words have meaning. They have value truth.
    <br> You changed everything about it.
  </p>

  <p> I don't know you. What is it you desire? Truth? Reason? Why do you yearn?
    <br> "I loved you."
    <br> Things change. Even the love I shared.
  </p>
